## Step 3: Configure SignPath.io

Once approved, you'll get access to SignPath.io:

### 3.1 Create SignPath Configuration

Create `.signpath.yml` in your repository root:

```yaml
# SignPath configuration for Comet Browser
version: 1.0

artifacts:
  - name: Comet Browser Windows Installer
    description: Windows NSIS installer for Comet Browser
    type: nsis-installer
    
    file-metadata-restrictions:
      product-name: Comet Browser
      product-version: ${VERSION}
      
    signing-configuration:
      kind: authenticode
      
    build:
      project-file: package.json
      build-command: npm run dist:win
      
  - name: Comet Browser Executable
    description: Main Comet Browser executable
    type: pe-file
    
    file-metadata-restrictions:
      product-name: Comet Browser
      product-version: ${VERSION}
      
    signing-configuration:
      kind: authenticode
```

### 3.2 Update GitHub Actions Workflow

Modify `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build and Sign Comet Browser

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Build Next.js app
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Build unsigned executable
        run: npm run dist:win
        env:
          CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY: false
      
      - name: Upload to SignPath
        uses: signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request@v1
        with:
          api-token: ${{ secrets.SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN }}
          organization-id: ${{ secrets.SIGNPATH_ORGANIZATION_ID }}
          project-slug: 'comet-browser'
          signing-policy-slug: 'release-signing'
          artifact-configuration-slug: 'windows-installer'
          input-artifact-path: 'release/Comet Browser Setup *.exe'
          output-artifact-path: 'release/signed/'
          wait-for-completion: true
      
      - name: Upload signed artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: comet-browser-windows-signed
          path: release/signed/*.exe
```

---

## Step 4: GitHub Secrets Configuration

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. **SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN**:
   - Get from SignPath.io dashboard
   - Settings → API Tokens → Create new token

2. **SIGNPATH_ORGANIZATION_ID**:
   - Found in SignPath.io dashboard URL
   - Format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

### How to Add Secrets:

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add each secret

---

## Step 5: Release Process

### 5.1 Create a Release

```bash
# Tag a new version
git tag v0.1.9
git push origin v0.1.9
```

### 5.2 Approve Signing Request

1. GitHub Actions builds the unsigned executable
2. Uploads to SignPath.io
3. **You** (as approver) log into SignPath.io
4. Review the signing request
5. Click "Approve"
6. SignPath signs the executable
7. GitHub Actions downloads signed file
8. Creates GitHub release with signed executable

## Benefits of SignPath Foundation

### ✅ Advantages:

1. **Completely Free** - No annual fees
2. **Trusted Certificate** - Issued by DigiCert via SignPath Foundation
3. **No SmartScreen Warnings** - Immediate trust
4. **Automated** - Integrates with GitHub Actions
5. **Transparent** - Build process is verifiable
6. **Community Support** - Designed for OSS projects

### ⚠️ Considerations:
