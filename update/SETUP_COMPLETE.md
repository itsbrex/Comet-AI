# ✅ Android Production Key Setup Complete!

## What I Did:

### 1. Generated Production Keystore ✅
- Created `upload-keystore.jks` in `flutter_browser_app/android/app/`
- This is your **production signing key** for the Play Store
- **Password**: `cometbrowser` (for both store and key)
- **Alias**: `upload`
- **Validity**: 10,000 days (~27 years)

### 2. Created Local Configuration ✅
- Created `key.properties` in `flutter_browser_app/android/`
- Both files are gitignored for security

### 3. Updated Build Configuration ✅
- Modified `build.gradle` to fall back to debug signing if keystore is missing
- This allows builds to succeed in environments without the production key

### 4. Configured GitHub Actions ✅
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` to:
  - Decode keystore from GitHub Secrets
  - Create key.properties dynamically
  - Build signed release APK

### 5. Added Caching ✅
- **Android**: Gradle caching (already configured)
- **iOS**: CocoaPods caching
- **Desktop**: Next.js build caching

## 🚀 Next Steps - GitHub Actions Setup:

### Add these 4 secrets to your GitHub repository:

**Go to**: Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

#### Secret 1: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
**Value**: Copy the ENTIRE content from:
`flutter_browser_app/android/app/keystore-base64.txt`

(All 61 lines including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`)

#### Secret 2: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
**Value**: `cometbrowser`

#### Secret 3: `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
**Value**: `upload`

#### Secret 4: `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`
**Value**: `cometbrowser`

## 📝 Important Security Notes:

### DO NOT commit to git:
- ❌ `upload-keystore.jks`
- ❌ `keystore-base64.txt`
- ❌ `key.properties`

These are already in `.gitignore` ✅

### BACKUP these files securely:
- 💾 `upload-keystore.jks` - Store in a password manager or encrypted backup
- 💾 Password: `cometbrowser`

**⚠️ WARNING**: If you lose the keystore file, you can NEVER update your app on the Play Store. You would have to publish it as a completely new app with a new package name.

## 🧪 Testing:

### Local Build (should work now):
```bash
cd flutter_browser_app
flutter build apk --release
```

### GitHub Actions Build:
Once you add the 4 secrets, push a tag:
```bash
git tag v0.1.9
git push origin v0.1.9
```

The workflow will automatically build signed APKs for Android, iOS, and desktop platforms.

## 📦 What Gets Built:

- **Android**: Signed release APK (ready for Play Store)
- **iOS**: Unsigned IPA (needs code signing for App Store)
- **Windows**: Signed installer (.exe)
- **macOS**: DMG package
- **Linux**: AppImage

All artifacts will be attached to the GitHub Release draft.
